## Installing plugins

1. Make sure you're on the latest version of the Stream Deck software by checking for updates in the app.
2. Browse the list below. When you find a plugin you like, hit the 'Download' link to be taken to the list of releases. Pick the most recent version (generally the best option), which will download a '.streamDeckPlugin' file to your computer.
3. Open the new file by double-clicking on it, or launching from your browser. The Stream Deck app will open, and the new plugin will have loaded one or more actions under the 'Custom Actions' header at the bottom-right. Drag the new action onto your Stream Deck and get streaming!
